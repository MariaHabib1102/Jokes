A website that fetches data (jokes) from an external API and displays it on the screen. Weâ€™ll be using React completely to base this website. Each time we reload the page and click the button, a new joke is fetched and rendered on the screen by React. As we are using React for this project, we need not reload the page to display the fetched data.

## Prerequisite

- React
- Function Components
- ReactJS AJAX and API
- useState

## File Structure

- `App.js`: This file imports the components to render it on the web page.
- `Joke.js`: This file contains the joke to be displayed and makes the API call.
- `Joke.css`: This file contains the styling of all the elements.
- `Button.js`: This file contains the button component which generates the joke on click.
- `Button.css`: This file contains the styling of the button element.

## To run Application

1. Type the following command in the terminal of your project directory:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. Type the following URL in your web browser:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/
